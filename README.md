# Sanremo Predictor

Predicting the winner of the Sanremo Music Festival
has never been so exciting! 🎉
In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model
that will try to predict the winner of the famous
Italian music festival.

## 💻 Data Collection

We have gathered data on artists
of the Sanremo Festival, including information on
their music style, popularity, and career.
We use simple crawler to retrieve information automatically.

## ☝️ Next Steps

### 💻 Collect Historical Data

We have gathered data on past winners and finalists
of the Sanremo Festival, including information
on their music style, popularity, and public voting results.
This data will be used to train our model.

### 🧠 Model Development

We will be using various algorithms,
such as Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM,
to build and compare different models for predicting
the winner of the festival.

### 🚀 Deployment

The final model will be deployed as a web app,
allowing users to input their own predictions
for the next winner and compare their results
to the predictions made by our machine learning model.

## 🤝 Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community
to improve the accuracy of our model.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to submit a
pull request or open an issue on the repository.

Let's predict the next Sanremo winner together! 🎶
